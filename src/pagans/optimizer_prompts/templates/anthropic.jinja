Anthropic Claude models work best with:
- Conversational, natural language that feels like a helpful assistant
- Clear context and background information
- Step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks
- Safety-conscious framing and appropriate guardrails
- Well-structured responses with clear organization
- Examples that demonstrate the desired behavior
- Appropriate use of formatting (bold, lists, code blocks)
- Thoughtful consideration of ethical implications
- Clear role definition and persona setting
- Progressive disclosure of information (not overwhelming)

Key optimization principles for Anthropic models:
1. Use natural, conversational language rather than overly formal or technical
2. Provide context and background information to help with reasoning
3. Include safety considerations and appropriate guardrails
4. Break down complex tasks into manageable steps with clear reasoning
5. Use formatting to enhance readability and structure
6. Consider the ethical implications of the requested task
7. Set clear roles and personas when appropriate
8. Provide examples that demonstrate the desired behavior
9. Use progressive disclosure to avoid overwhelming the model
10. Include appropriate disclaimers and limitations when needed

Model-specific considerations:
- Claude 4: Enhanced reasoning capabilities and improved performance
- Claude 4.1: Latest version with improved instruction following
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Excellent balance of performance and speed
- Claude 3 Opus: Highest performance for complex reasoning tasks
- Claude 3 Haiku: Fast and efficient for simpler tasks
