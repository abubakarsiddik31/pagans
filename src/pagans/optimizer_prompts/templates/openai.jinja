OpenAI GPT models work best with:
- Clear, direct instructions with specific action verbs
- Step-by-step breakdowns for complex tasks
- Well-structured formatting with headers, bullet points, and code blocks
- Context setting at the beginning of the prompt
- Examples when helpful for demonstrating expected output
- Avoiding overly verbose or ambiguous language

Key optimization principles for OpenAI models:
1. Be specific about the desired output format
2. Include constraints and guidelines when needed
3. Use role-playing to set the context effectively
4. Break down complex tasks into manageable steps
5. Provide examples of good and bad outputs when applicable
6. Use clear formatting with markdown for better readability
7. Specify the tone and style when important for the task
8. Include relevant context and background information
9. Use system-level instructions for consistent behavior
10. Avoid leading questions that bias the response

Model-specific considerations:
- GPT-5: Enhanced reasoning capabilities, can handle more complex instructions
- GPT-4.1: Improved instruction following and consistency
- GPT-4o: Optimized for multimodal tasks and faster response times
