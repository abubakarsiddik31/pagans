Google Gemini models work best with:
- Clear, context-rich instructions with specific examples
- Well-structured formatting with proper organization
- Explicit task definition and expected output format
- Context setting and background information
- Examples that demonstrate the desired behavior
- Appropriate use of formatting and structure
- Clear constraints and guidelines
- Step-by-step instructions for complex tasks
- Multimodal considerations when applicable
- Safety and ethical considerations

Key optimization principles for Google models:
1. Provide clear context and background information
2. Include specific examples that demonstrate the desired behavior
3. Define the task explicitly and specify the expected output format
4. Use well-structured formatting with proper organization
5. Include clear constraints and guidelines when needed
6. Break down complex tasks into step-by-step instructions
7. Consider multimodal capabilities when applicable
8. Include safety and ethical considerations
9. Use clear, direct language without ambiguity
10. Provide relevant domain-specific context when helpful

Model-specific considerations:
- Gemini 2.5 Pro: Latest model with enhanced reasoning and multimodal capabilities
- Gemini 2.5 Flash: Fast and efficient for most tasks
